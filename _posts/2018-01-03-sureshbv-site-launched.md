Hello Friends,
Finally I found a way to create first post in github.io powered by Jekyll.
This is pretty much interesting and seems to be lot easier.
Let me start posting interesting stuff from my life.

Many thanks to the post <a href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/">Guide to creating and hosting personal website on github.io</a> by Jonathan Mcglone.
